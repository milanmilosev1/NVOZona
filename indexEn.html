        &emsp; Zona is a non-governmental non-profit organization founded in
        2024 as an initiative of a former participant of the UWC course
        "Building a Sustainable Future", Miona Kosijer, in order to realize her
        post-course project. All members and participants who contribute to the
        work of the organization, from designing posts on social networks to the
        implementation of the events themselves, participate on a volunteer
        basis. Through its work, the organization will deal with topics such as

        and economic sustainability.

            &emsp; Hello everyone, my name is Miona Kosijer and I am the one who
            started the idea of this organization and our first project. I am a
            student of the "International Baccalaureate" program at the
            gymnasium "Jovan Jovanović Zmaj" over the course of two years,
            before which I attended the gymnasium "Isidora Sekulić". During
            2021, which was also my first year in high school, I started
            attending various types of informal education through workshops and
            different events. Now, three years later, I am presented with the
            opportunity to be the organizer of such an event. Participating in
            the UWC "Building a Sustainable Future" course helped me to see the
            importance of the concept of sustainable development for all
            communities, but especially for the youth and future generations.
            With the support and help of UWC Deutschland, my mentor and other
            team members, I manage to plan, organize and soon realize the
            project called "Sustainable paths".

            &emsp; Hi everyone, I’m Jana Srdanov. I am from Zrenjanin, where I
            attended a humanities and languages oriented program in the
            gymnasium, after which I enrolled into a two-year "International
            Baccalaureate" (IB) program in the gymnasium “Jovan Jovanovic Zmaj”,
            where I met Miona. Up until then I was engaged in psychology,
            history, literature and a little activism. I take up this project as
            a part of my own CAS project for the IB program. A project like this
            requires acquiring new and expanding existing knowledge at the same
            time. My goal is to, together with Miona, change young people’s
            minds about sustainable development and, through participation in
            this project, raise the level of awareness of the youth.

            why I wanted to help Miona with this project. The two of us met
            through participation in a project similar to this one almost 3
            years ago. I believe that this topic is one of the most important
            today, and of course in the future, and I am glad that, by doing
            what I love and what I am good at, I can contribute to the goal of

          &emsp; The introductory part of the workshops will last between 20 and
          30 minutes. During this time, the guest lecturer introduces the
          participants to the topic of the workshop. The rest of the time is
          devoted to activities through which the topic is further discussed and

          &emsp; Workshops are led and facilitated by high school and university
          students who have been engaged in this field for a long time through
          work and volunteerism. The workshops themselves are divided into an
          introductory part, which consists of a lecture during which
          participants have the opportunity to familiarize themselves with basic
          concepts and vocabulary related to the topic of the workshop, and to
          the interactive part where the topic is further discussed and explored
          through various activities. Throughout these workshops, attendees will
          be encouraged to practice their public speaking, debate and dialogue
          approaches and with it better their overall conversation skills that
          would prepare them for active participation and further discussions.
          The implementation of this project is planned to achieve a better
          understanding of the topic of sustainability amongst the youth in our
          local community and motivate them to continue learning and
          participating in this and topics such as this one. By doing this, we
          hope to create a spread of information amongst all citizens and make a
          long lasting change.
